UVR_Patch_12_13_22_3_37

Change Log:

Fixes & Changes:

~ The progress bar is now fully synced up with every process in the application.
~ Drag-n-drop feature should now work every time.
~ Users can now drop massive amounts of files and directories as inputs, and the application will add them to the conversion list.
~ Various bug fixes for the Download Center.
~ Various design changes.

Performance:

~ Model load times are faster.
~ Importing/exporting audio files is faster.

New Options:

~ "Select Saved Settings" option - Allows the user to save the current settings of the whole application or reset them to the default.
~ "Right-click" menu - Allows for quick access to important options.
~ "Help Hints" option - When enabled, users can hover over options to see pop-up text that describes that option. The right-clicking option also allows copying the "Help Hint" text.
~ Secondary Model Mode - This option is an expanded version of the "Demucs Model" option that was only available to MDX-Net. Except now, this option is available in all three AI Networks and stems. Any model can now be Secondary, and the user can choose the amount of influence the Secondary model has, unlike before.
~ Robust caching for ensemble mode, allowing for much faster processing times.
~ You can now drag and drop as many files/folders as inputs. The application willautomatically go through each selected directory for audio files.
~ Clicking the "Input" field will pop-up a new window that allows the user to go through all of the selected audio inputs and remove some, if desired.

VR Architecture:

~ Support for the latest VR architecture
    ~ Crop Size and Batch Size are specifically for models using the latest architecture only.
    ~ Ability to toggle "High-End Processing."

MDX-NET:

~ "Denoise Output" option - When enabled, this option results in cleaner results, but the processing time will be longer. This option has replaced Noise Reduction.
~ "Spectral Inversion" option - This option uses inversion techniques for a cleaner secondary stem result. This option may slow down the audio export process.
~ Secondary stem now has the same frequency cut-off as the main stem.

Demucs:

~ Demucs v4 models are now supported, including the 6 stem models.
~ Ability to combine remaining stems instead of inverting selected stems with the mixture only when a user selects 2 stems.
~ A "Pre-process" model that allows the user to run an inference through a robust vocal or instrumental model and separate the remaining stems from its generated instrumental mix. This option can significantly reduce vocal bleed in other Demucs-generated non-vocal stems. 

Ensemble Mode: 

~ Ensemble Mode has been extended to include the following:
    ~ "Averaging" is a new algorithm that averages the final results.
    ~ Unlimited models in the ensemble.
    ~ Ability to save different ensembles.
    ~ Ability to ensemble outputs for all individual stem types.
    ~ Ability to choose unique ensemble algorithms.
    ~ Ability to ensemble all 4 Demucs stems at once.
